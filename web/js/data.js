But we're here to assure you—it's even trickier when you've got 40+ million active global customers and development teams distributed across the world. So to help illustrate the work that goes into that process, two Groupon engineers are here to talk about the lessons they've learned along the way.","bio":" \n            Abhi is a software engineer at Groupon and is currently working on a handful of back-end applications that enable inventory configuration, transaction, and management.

The task of maintaining rules becomes complex. The challenge compounds further in a heterogeneous environment, with services built in different languages.\nIn this talk, I focus on the topic of authorization, specifically how we can scale and grow our services with confidence.

Have you ever told someone on your team “remember to update the client-side views too”? Too long has the node.js community touted their advantage of using the same code on the client and the server. It’s time that Rails got a few punches in.We should think of views as objects, not template files. In this talk I show how that lets us tease apart presentation from data, and build logic-less templates that are shared between client and server.","bio":" Andrew Warner studied CS and Psychology at Wesleyan.

It's intuitive and easy to use in small apps that don't have lots of models. You can select, join, and where your way into a great, working app in no time. Then your app starts to grow, you add more models, and you need to start building more and more complex queries.

However, it’s common to face situations that require us to write more complex code on our own, and sometimes we forget a little about what Rails can do for us. We are going through some Rails features that people might not be aware of, talking about Active Record queries, custom template handlers, routing niceties, view helpers and more, to learn how these tricks can help simplifying complex code on our apps.","bio":" Carlos (@cantoniodasilva) hacks beautiful code at Plataformatec, a consultancy firm based in Brazil, and is member of the Rails Core Team.

On the client, more than anywhere else, the M is the key to creating powerful user experiences.To demonstrate this principle in action, we'll first create an in-memory model of what a color is, and then use it to build an interactive 3D color chooser that is both beautiful and intuitive.Sound hard? Not with when you're armed with well defined models... not when you've got the Power of M on your side.","bio":" Charles is a rubyist and entrepreneur who has been building software human interfaces for over ten years.\n\nA founder at The Frontside, he is also the creator of several open source projects that bridge together the worlds of Ruby and JavaScript including The Ruby Racer and The Ruby Rhino.\n"},{"title":"Secrets of a World Memory Champion","speaker":"Chris Hunt","abstract":"You don't have a bad memory, you were just never taught how to use it.

Hours of nightmarish, manual brain surgery later, enough is enough.What happens when background jobs grow as bloated as the MonoRail™ that begot them?Rather than reach for the latest fad off of HackerNews, we'll user Ruby and Rails to automate error-recovery, concurrent processing, and catch corrupt data before it brings everything down.","bio":" Typist, Philosopher at ZenPayroll.

Faced with a growing codebase, slower tests and performance issues, we've extracted services from our large Rails app the way we do everything else: iteratively. I’ll walk through what we did right, and what we almost did wrong.","bio":" It took a while for Eric to come around to programming, trying a few other careers first.

Mutation testing is a technique to evaluate the quality of your tests by programmatically mutating (i.e. making a series of small modifications to) your code and ensuring that the tests no longer pass. This talk will attempt to demonstrate the value of mutation testing and show you how to use Mutant to improve the quality of your tests and your code.","bio":" Erik Michaels-Ober is a programmer.\n"},{"title":"Curmudgeon: An Opinionated Look at an Opinionated Framework","speaker":"Ernie Miller","abstract":"Rails has opinions about how we should organize code, interact with a database, write tests, format URLs... just about everything. These conventions, the wisdom goes, free us up to focus on the specifics of our application. \"Convention over configuration\" becomes our mantra as development hurtles forward with startling speed.At some point, we stop. We take stock of what we've built, and it's a mess. How did we get here?Turns out, the decisions that Rails made for us had consequences.","bio":" Ernie's been writing code since he was 6 years old, but only getting paid to do so for the past 16 years or so.

Does testing any bit of application logic require fixtures and setup helpers a mile long?Evented patterns create a vocabulary of what happens in your system, and a way to separate code triggering events from code that responds to them. That helps tame the sprawl by setting clean boundaries, simplifying tests, and keeping your dependencies isolated.This talk reveals the power of events and what's already in Rails to help you.","bio":" I fell in love with programming watching my dad work in Clipper and dBase III (no, really).

Why is it part of the Rails Way?","speaker":"Javier Ramirez","abstract":"When David Heinemeier Hansson started talking about REST in 2006, little could we suspect it'd become such a central part of Rails (and of web development in general). Back then a web service meant something you coded using XML and SOAP. Those were dark times.

Others may be at a point in their career where they feel stalled out and might want to see if management is right for them. Moving from a software role to a management role doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice all your technical/coding skills, but it does mean you need to cultivate some new ones.","bio":" Jessie is the Director of Engineering at Lookingglass Cyber Solutions.

Testing is core to the culture of Ruby, and the tools are sophisticated, but something big is missing from the workflow. Namely, a powerful debugger. Integrating Pry creates an interactive, enjoyable TDD workflow. In this talk, I'll recount the somewhat unique development experience that made me a believer. I'll demonstrate with Pry a responsive and immersive TDD cycle, taking a test to green before it exits its first run.","bio":" Joel Turnbull is a Code Designer at Gaslight.

The failure of Rails has been its perception as \"best web framework ever\" instead of \"best web framework for apps like Basecamp\". Given that, it's clear why Rails makes writing a UI in HTML a joy but does few favors for JavaScript-heavy apps. Joy can be had in JavaScript, and we'll show how with Lineman.js & tools extracted to help find it!","bio":" Justin Searls has two professional passions: writing great software and sharing what he’s learned in order to help others write even greater software.
