The discussion will include how to identify, fix, and prevent the issues with an emphasis on practical advice.  Along the way we will share our experiences and perspectives concerning securely implementing applications.  We hope it is a bit scary, and yet fun … like a horror movie!", "bio": " Aaron is a Senior Fellow at Groupon where he works on all things open source.

But we're here to assure you—it's even trickier when you've got 40+ million active global customers and development teams distributed across the world. So to help illustrate the work that goes into that process, two Groupon engineers are here to talk about the lessons they've learned along the way.", "bio": " \n            Abhi is a software engineer at Groupon and is currently working on a handful of back-end applications that enable inventory configuration, transaction, and management. A little over two years ago, he attended Code Academy (now known as The Starter League) and was introduced to awesome mentors at Groupon. Since then, Abhi has spent each day surrounded by amazing developers and learning how to build great software at scale.\n                      \n           \n           Jason has been a software engineer at Groupon since March 2012. Prior to being abducted out of an Indiana cornfield by Groupon’s notorious cat-piloted spacecraft, he spent four years as the primary builder and Ruby/Rails foreman at Mobi Wireless Management in Indianapolis. Before that, he wore a lot of different hats inside Indiana University's IT enterprise. Earlier still, he went to college to become a journalist—but became entranced by the web instead. He loves software as a means to solve real-world problems and derives joy from agile production, pair programming, and knowledge sharing.\n            \n          "}
